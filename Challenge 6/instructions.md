Fizz Buzz Challenge 6:

THE END OF THE CONSOLE LOG 
We will now do the exact same thing from challenge 5 but not in the console.

In a for loop from 0 to 50 do the following logic:
If counter is divisible by 3 then print to the screen "Fizz!", if it not divisible by 3 and it is divisible by 5 then print to the screen 'BUZZ!', if it is divisible by both print to the screen "FIZZ BUZZ!" and if it is divisibly by neither 3 nor 5 then print to the screen the value of counter
